Hi everyone! We're happy to introduce Canner v3, which comes with following great features:
* Enhanced developer experience
* Built-in Authentication
* GraphQL Playground
* GraphQL API Access
* Supporting Firebase, Firestore and MongoDB
* Perfectly decoupled services
* Fully Self-hosted

<!--truncate-->

## Enhanced developer experience
Now, with `@canner/cli`, you can develop Canner CMS with better overview to all the logs, document and debug information.

> **Quickstart**
>
> Read our [quickstart guide](/docs/start-quick-3commands) to build CMS in 3 commands.


## Authentication
We use OpenID Connect compliant authentication service to protect your CMS and GraphQL API.

Since we use OpenID Connect, it's possible you replace our build-in authentication service with [`Auth0`](https://auth0.com), [`Okta`](https://www.okta.com/) or [`Keycloak`](https://www.keycloak.org/). 

Basically any service compliant to OpenID Connect can integrate with Canner CMS easily.

## GraphQL Playground
Right now, with GraphQL Playground, it's easier for you to debug and make queries to see the changes.

## GraphQL API Access
Supporting GraphQL API Access has been one of the most requested feature in Canner Community.

**We hear you and we made it happen!**

At Canner v3, you can set a `readOnlyAccessToken`, allowing all the clients to access the GraphQL API without ability to mutate the data.

> **ReadOnly GraphQL API Access**
>
> Learn more about it at [ReadOnly GraphQL API Access Section](/docs/graphql-api-read-only-access)

## Supporting Firebase, Firestore and MongoDB
With our open-sourced GraphQL API Integration Framework [GQLify](https://gqlify.com) integrated with Canner, we officially support [Firebase](/docs/data-source-firebase), [Firestore](/docs/data-source-firestore) and [MongoDB](/docs/data-source-mongodb).

It comes with better interface for developers to customize their own dataSource.

> Learn more about [customizing dataSource](/docs/data-source-customize)

## Perfectly decoupled services
Canner decoupled itself into three services:
* **CMS Service**: Hosting CMS views and static files.
* **GraphQL Service**: Handling GraphQL Requests from CMS and clients.
* **Authentication Service**: Rendering Login view and compliant with OpenID Connect.

You can easily replace GraphQL Service with your own GraphQL Server, or separate out the GraphQL Service to scale it.

## Fully Self-hosted
Canner is fully open-sourced and can be hosted on anywhere you want.

We're currently building the official docker image to make it even easier for you.

## ðŸš¨ Migration from Canner v2 -> v3
> **Notice**
>
> For developers using Canner v2, we still have an issue on the different implementation on `to-many` relations.
>
> We're currently dealing with it and we'll release a migration guide as soon as possible once we add this feature.

## ðŸŒŸ What's next?
We still have some work to do before Canner v3 becomes totally stable.

Here's the roadmap of our next steps:
* **[Important]** Add tutorials section to v3 document.
* **[Important]** Add more topics and guide regarding customization on Style changing, Authentication alternatives integrations and deployment guide ...etc.
* **[Important]** Publish official docker image.
* **[Important]** Migration guide from Canner v2 to v3.
* **[Important]** Canner Cloud migration to v3.
* **[Important]** More e2e tests to make it even more stable.
* **[Important]** Performance tuning on DataSource queries.
* **[Important]** More access control policy on GraphQL API.
* **[Minor]** Add Prisma Support to Canner v3.
