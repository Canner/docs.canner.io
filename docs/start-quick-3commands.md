## 1. Install Canner CLI

Make sure you have already installed NodeJS and use the command below to install `@canner/cli` globally. And as the [official NPM docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) mentioned, we also recommend using a Node version manager to prevent the [EACCESS issue](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).


```shell
$ npm install -g @canner/cli
```

Check the installation with

```shell
$ canner --version
```

#### Note
- Your Node version must at least >= 6.10. 
#### Troubleshooting
- [EACCESS: permission denied](https://github.com/Canner/canner/issues/139)


## 2. Initialize project
In the Canner project, there are some important files you have to know, [`canner.schema.js`](file-canner-schema-js.md), [`canner.server.js`](file-canner-server-js.md), and [`canner.cloud.js`](file-canner-cloud-js.md). 

`canner.schema.js` is the most important one, which defines the data model and UIs of your CMS. It's written with `jsx`, a XML-like language, and is easy to learn and understand.

`canner.server.js` and `canner.cloud.js` are both configurations for hosting, such as the [**theme**](guides-theme), [**sidebar menu**](guides-sidebar.md), [**data sources**](data-source-overview.md), ...etc. The difference between them are the former one is used for self-hosting, which means you can locally serve and host your CMS and GraphQL APIs. The latter one is for Canner Cloud platform, which helps you to host the CMS on [cannercms.com](https://cannercms.com).

In this step, we create the three files with CLI. You can take a look at the files, and edit them by the following guides.

Now, let's create a empty folder and enter it.

```shell
$ mkdir my-cms
$ cd my-cms
```

Initialize the package.json and install the dependencies:

```shell
$ npm init
$ npm install --save-dev @gqlify/server
```

Run command:

```shell
$ canner init
```

It ask you to select a schema template. Feel free to select any one of them, you can easily change afterwards.

```shell
Initializing...
What template do you want to create? Blog
? This will override the file and folder below, do you want to continue?
 	/Users/siou/Code/test10/canner.schema.js
	/Users/siou/Code/test10/schema
	/Users/siou/Code/test10/components

 Yes
âœ” Initialized


Next Steps:

  - Host your CMS: canner start

  - Follow the docs below to connect your data source:
      Firebase: http://www.canner.io/docs/next/data-source-firebase
      Firestore: http://www.canner.io/docs/next/data-source-firestore

  - Deploy to Canner cloud:
      http://www.canner.io/docs/next/guides-deploy-to-canner
```

And then, there will be serveral files and folders under the  directory.

- `canner.schema.js and schema/\*.schema.js`:
The schema of the CMS, defines the data model and UI.
- `components/\*.js`:
The customized components, not every projects have this.
- `canner.server.js`:
The configuration of **OSS** version, you can change the *dataSources*, *i18n*, *sidebar*, *style*, ...etc.
- `canner.cloud.js`:
The configuration of **Cloud** version, you can change the *dataSources*, *i18n*, *sidebar*, *style*, ...etc.

## 3. Host the CMS locally

Simply type `canner start`, this command will read the configuration from `canner.server.js` and serve it. You can edit it by the following [guides](file-canner-server-js.md).


When running the command, it displays an awesome dashboard displaying the progress of the static files building, server status, and server logs, ...etc. 

![start-command-dashboard](/docs/assets/start-command-dashboard.png)

Here are the actions actually doing in the background.

- **Build static files**:
The static files of the CMS is generated under `./.cms`.
- **Build json schema**:
The JSON schema of your canner schema is generated called `canner.schema.json`.
- **Host the CMS**
Host the path `./.cms` at `http://localhost:3000`
- **Run the GraphQL server**
Parse `canner.schema.json` to [GQLify data modal](https://www.gqlify.com/docs/data-model-overview), and the endpoint will expose at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`


After the line `Server ready on port 3000` shows on dashboard, you can go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your CMS and login with the default username and password, `canner`.

**After loging in, here is your CMS!**
