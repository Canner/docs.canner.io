Hi all!

Thank you for joining the Canner community! Having had launched our first open source Alpha version this past May, Canner has grown rapidly in the open source community, and we couldn’t have done it without you, thank you for your support. 

Since then, we have amassed over 2.3k stars on Github and accumulated over 50,000 downloads on npm. Our users are able to employ our CMS to diverse applications such as websites, mobile apps, and even server management systems.
