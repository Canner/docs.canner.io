There are two way to deploy your CMS.

- [Deploy with Docker](guides-deployment-of-docker.md)
- [Deploy to Canner Cloud](guides-deployment-of-canner.md). In this way, you just need to edit the `canner.cloud.js`, the configuration of Canner cloud, and deploy your CMS to Canner cloud with the CLI command. It's the simplest way to deploy your CMS.
