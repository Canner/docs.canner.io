Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a surging cloud computing service with popular services such as Firebase, Parse, GraphCool, Kinvey, that help developers to connect their applications to backend cloud storage, and provide common features such as user management, push notification and social network integration, allowing developers develop faster and more securely on mobile and web applications. More and more developers now prefer to use BaaS to build their own backend, because it saves time and resources.

In this post, we are going to talk about why you should build CMS on BaaS, using Firebase, which is the major BaaS as of today, as an example.

## Challenges in Firebase
After you decide to use Firebase as backend in your applications, several challenges arise.

**1. How could other developers and editorial members in my team update the content stored in Firebase?**

**2. How could the customer service team search for user's data in Firebase database, when customers ask for help?**

**3. How could I better maintain data on websites and apps, should I update my code every time I change content or should I change from Firebase console directly?**

**4. Should I edit my database from Firebase console every time to update data in Firebase database when it is so dangerous to do so?**

**5. If you are an outsourcing company, you might ask: "How could my client update the data?"**

> All these problems point to the for a CMS to help manage content.

But should I then build a dashboard, which might takes more time than building applications?

## Top 5 reasons you should have a Firebase CMS

### 1. Usability
With a delightful and easy to use interface, empowers your team to manage and maintain data without any engineer.

### 2. Reusability
CMS defined in schema, without any hard-coded programming. This allow you to reuse and rebuild your CMS fast.

### 3. Security
To prevent team members directly modify data in Firebase database, the best way is to provide members a CMS interface.

### 4. Maintainability
Without knowing data structure and data relationships, most of the time the data in Firebase are hard to maintain by others. It's better to have a meaningful interface for others.

### 5. Collaboration
In a team sometimes there are others that don't know Firebase and non-technical people. With a CMS, allows your team to start collaborating together.
