## 1. Install Canner CLI

Make sure you have already installed NodeJS and use the command below to install `@canner/cli` globally. And as the [official NPM docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) mentioned, we also recommend using a Node version manager to prevent the [EACCESS issue](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).


```shell
$ npm install -g @canner/cli
```

Check the installation with

```shell
$ canner --version
```

#### Note
- Your Node version must at least >= 6.10. 
#### Troubleshooting
- [EACCESS: permission denied](https://github.com/Canner/canner/issues/139)


## 2. Initialize project
In a Canner project, there are some important files you have to know, [`canner.schema.js`](file-canner-schema-js.md), [`canner.server.js`](file-canner-server-js.md), and [`canner.cloud.js`](file-canner-cloud-js.md). 

`canner.schema.js` is the most important one, which defines the data model and UIs of your CMS. It's written with `jsx`, a XML-like language, and is easy to learn and understand.

`canner.server.js` and `canner.cloud.js` are both the configuration of the features that Canner schema doesn't support such as the [**theme**](guides-theme), [**sidebarMenu**](guides-sidebar.md), [**dataSources**](data-source-overview.md), ...etc. The difference between them are the former one is used for self-hosting which means CLI runs the server to host your CMS and GraphQL APIs. Of course, it has more options about the server. The latter one is for Canner Cloud, which helps you to host the CMS and support external features more easily.

In this step, we create the three files with CLI. You can take a look on the files, and edit them by following the guides.


Now, let's create a empty folder and enter it.

```shell
$ mkdir my-cms
$ cd my-cms
```

Run command:

```shell
$ canner init
```

It ask you to select a schema template you want to use. Feel free to select any one of them.

```shell
Initializing...
? What template do you want to create? Blog
âœ” Initialized


Next Steps:

  - Serve your CMS: canner script:serve

  - Or follow the docs below to connect your data source:
      Firebase Admin: https://www.canner.io/docs/credential-firebase
      Prisma: https://www.canner.io/docs/credential-prisma
```

And then, there will be serveral files and folders under the currect directory.

- `canner.schema.js and schema/\*.schema.js`
The schema of the CMS, defines the data model and UI.
- `components/\*.js`
The customized components, not every project would have this.
- `canner.server.js`
The configuration of **OSS** version, you can change the *dataSources*, *i18n*, *sidebar*, *style*, ...etc.
- `canner.cloud.js`
The configuration of **Cloud** version, you can change the *dataSources*, *i18n*, *sidebar*, *style*, ...etc.


## 3. Host the CMS locally

Simply type `canner start` and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your CMS. The command will do the actions below.

#### Build static files
The static files of the CMS is generated under `./.cms`.
#### Build json schema
The JSON schema of your canner schema is generated called `canner.schema.json`.
#### Host the CMS
Host the path `./.cms` at `http://localhost:3000`
#### Run the GraphQL server
Parse `canenr.schema.json` to [GQLify data modal](https://www.gqlify.com/docs/data-model-overview), and the endpoint is `http://localhost:3000/graphql`

**Go to http://localhost:3000, you will see the CMS**
