## 3. CMS framework redesign

This version we also redesign our CMS framework from the ground up.  Here's some highlight for our new design.

### canner-script - JSX

Our CMS framework schema is redesign using `JSX` as syntax instead of `CannerTypes` object. This could help developers to improve development flow, simplicity and scalability when writing Canner CMS schema.

And we rename to `canner-script`

### Data interface - GraphQL

One of our missions in Canner is building a universal CMS interface that could easily adapts fo different APIs and data sources. After years of research we found out `GraphQL` interface can help us achieve more and better performance.

### Resolvers

In order to achive customize data flow and use cases. We support resolvers in our CMS.

### Customize CMS component

We have many requests from our users to all users to customize their own components. So we supported that too in our latest release!

## 4. Open source

One of our biggest news today is we are open sourcing our CMS framework on Github and we will keep improve and maintain the projects.

Our team at Canner, Inc. believe in open community, so we open sourced our CMS framework to share our reseach and technology to everyone. If you want to use our open source edition please visit ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ https://framework.canner.io/.

## 5. Standalone CMS for projects
